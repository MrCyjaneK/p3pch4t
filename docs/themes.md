# Themes

In today's world of instant messaging, the importance of themes cannot be overstated. It's no longer enough to simply send a message; one must also choose the perfect background to complement their words.

Gone are the days of plain white backgrounds and boring text. Now, messaging apps offer a vast array of themes to choose from, each one more exciting and attention-grabbing than the last.

Why settle for a simple text message when you can send a message accompanied by a cute puppy theme, complete with animated doggos running across the screen? Or perhaps you prefer a more sophisticated vibe, in which case you can opt for the elegant black and gold theme, complete with swirling patterns and regal-looking fonts.

But it's not just about aesthetics. Themes can also be a great way to express yourself and showcase your personality. Are you feeling festive? Why not choose the jolly Santa Claus theme to spread some holiday cheer? Or maybe you're feeling a bit rebellious, in which case the edgy skull and crossbones theme might be more your style.

Of course, the downside to all these fabulous themes is that they can be a bit distracting. It's hard to focus on a conversation when there are cartoon characters and sparkly graphics flashing across the screen. But hey, who needs focus when you have a cute kitten theme to distract you?

So next time you're messaging with friends, remember the importance of themes. Choose wisely, and you might just make a lasting impression. After all, nothing says "I'm a fun and interesting person" quite like a neon unicorn theme.

No, but seriously - it's a nice thing to have. Currently we support the following theming options:

 - Colors
 - Backgrounds

While Color can be any number from 0 to #ffFFFFFF backgrounds are predefined in client, a complete list of them can be found in assets/backgrounds/*.svg or .png (svg for the source and future version and png because flutter doesn't support repeat property currently.)
