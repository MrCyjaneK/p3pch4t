> ~~**NOTE:** This project is currently unmaintained. It is working, basics and some more advanced features are done but it requires a rewrite - as it is just a PoC. Because living on this planet isn't free and monetizing project that's fully open source wouldn't turn out well I had to pause the development. I will however resume the development once I get some funding for this app or get some more free time.~~

Current UI/UX is more of a demonstration of features and a raw access to backend rather than a final product. So don't get scared by how it looks at the moment.

#### Support

If you want to support the project leave me a star, join the Global Party group (link at the bottom of this readme) and share the app with others.

If you want to help with code: go ahead, clone the repository and mess around (you can also check the issues tab for a list of things that I am working on). Or if you are feeling fancy feel free to work on alternative clients. Good starting point for that is `lib/server/chat_server.dart`.

That being said, this project is still in it's early version. If you have any questions feel free to contact me:
