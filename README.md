# About

P3pch4t is a simple chat app that uses i2p to connect devices and pgp to encrypt messages. Check our our features:

###### Features

 - [x] Simple 1-1 chat
 - [x] Group chats
   - [x] SSMDC.v1 (one device is a group server)
   - [ ] ????? (Every device is independant)
 - [x] File sharing (no size limits)
 - [x] Message edits
 - [x] Chat customization (background color, for now, will add more options probably)
 - [ ] Message reactions
 - [ ] Single account on multiple devices
 - [ ] Backup and restore

Current UI/UX is more of a demonstration of features and a raw access to backend rather than a final product. So don't get scared by how it looks at the moment.

 - [ ] Windows
 - [ ] MacOS
 - [ ] iOS

#### Support

If you want to support the project leave me a star, join the Global Party group (link at the bottom of this readme) and share the app with others.

If you want to help with code: go ahead, clone the repository and mess around (you can also check the issues tab for a list of things that I am working on). Or if you are feeling fancy feel free to work on alternative clients. Good starting point for that is `lib/server/chat_server.dart`. 

------

That being said, this project is still in it's early version. If you have any questions feel free to contact me:

 - p3p dm: `/* none yet - join group */`
 - p3p group: `i2p://5no5y2sf7z4kc5plqedwodfcv3saiw5bbfezxpl6k2i5gvwnktbq.b32.i2p/ssmdc.v1/party` (hosted on a redmi 7a!)
 - XMPP: `x@stulpy.sk`
